Pursuit AI Cohort: The "Hello World" JourneyWelcome to the "Hello World" Journey repository! This project documents the evolution of a simple Python greeting script into a dynamic, interactive web application and a polished, multi-slide presentation. It serves as a practical case study in software development, showcasing iterative enhancement, the application of conditional logic, and the transformation from a back-end script to a user-facing front-end experience.üöÄ Live DemoYou can view and interact with the final presentation website, which was deployed using Netlify:View the Live Presentation Here(Note: Replace your-netlify-link.netlify.app with the actual URL from your Netlify deployment.)‚ú® Key FeaturesThe final web application is an interactive slideshow that demos the project itself. Its key features include:Interactive Slideshow: A multi-slide presentation built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.Thematic Design: Each slide features a unique, high-quality background image related to its topic, with a sleek, dark aesthetic for a modern feel.Live Applet: An interactive "Welcome Message Generator" is embedded directly into the presentation, allowing users to test the core logic in real-time.Conditional Logic: The generator uses smart conditional logic to provide different messages based on user input (e.g., a special greeting for "James Nelson") and the current time of day.Responsive Design: The presentation is fully responsive and looks great on devices of all sizes.Î∞ü Project EvolutionThis project was built iteratively, with each step adding a new layer of functionality and polish.The Foundation (welcome_script.py): The project began as a basic Python script. Its sole purpose was to generate and print a simple, hardcoded welcome message to the console.Adding Intelligence: The Python script was enhanced with conditional logic. An if/else statement was added to check for a specific name ("James Nelson") and provide a unique greeting. Further logic was added using the datetime library to make the greetings time-sensitive (e.g., "Good morning").The Leap to the Web: The core logic was translated from Python to JavaScript to run in a web browser. This logic was embedded in an HTML file, transforming the command-line tool into an interactive webpage with input fields and buttons.Professional UI/UX Design: The focus shifted to the user experience. The webpage was styled using Tailwind CSS, incorporating the official Pursuit branding (logo and fonts) and a professional background image to create a polished, visually appealing tool.The Final Product (presentation.html): The project culminated in the creation of an interactive, multi-slide presentation to showcase the journey. The web application itself was embedded within the presentation, creating a "demo within a demo" and providing a comprehensive overview of the project's evolution.üíª Technologies UsedPython: For the initial script and core logic concept.HTML5: For the structure of the web pages.CSS3 (Tailwind CSS): For all styling, layout, and responsive design.JavaScript: For the interactive logic, including the message generator, slide navigation, and DOM manipulation.Google Fonts: For professional typography (Poppins and Inter).Netlify: For deployment and hosting of the final web application.‚öôÔ∏è How to Run LocallyTo run this project on your local machine, simply download or clone the repository and open the presentation.html file in your preferred web browser.# Clone the repository
